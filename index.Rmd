# Overview

To propose a change, just click the pencil icon in the top left hand corner.

This list is maintained by [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com). See

## Technical bit 

The html files for this document live in the `docs/` directory of the [repository](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/podcasts/). Travis
creates the html files from the `.Rmd` files and commits them to the `docs/` directory.

## Original source

The idea came from a twitter conversation with [\@_ColinFay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay) and [\@ma_salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon) who pointed out
this great list of [sites](http://heidiseibold.github.io/2016/12/04/podcasts/) written by
[\@HeidiBaya](https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya).
